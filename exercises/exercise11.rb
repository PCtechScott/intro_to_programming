# This is just asking me to give an opinion on my favorite Ruby API sources.
# My favorite is going to be Ruby-Doc.org because I can't afford to
# confuse myself by using something other than what you use in
# the demos and exercises.

# It's also premature for me to start looking at rails stuff now,
# because of my struggles with ADD.

# If I happen to come across a different site that works better for
# my particular learning style, I will cheerfully sing its praises online
# in the Tealeaf forums or wherever else it seems appropriate. :P
