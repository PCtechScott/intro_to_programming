# Methods exercise 2

x = 2
# evaluates to => 2

puts x = 2
# prints 2, returns nil

p name = "Joe"
# Prints "Joe", returns "Joe" - not really getting the difference :(

four = "four"
# Betting this will return "four"
# OH how right I was.

print something = "nothing"
# Betting this returns "nothing"
# prints "nothing", then returns nil. Huh.
# Oh, I see the difference now.
